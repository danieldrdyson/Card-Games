//This program receives the shuffled deck of cards from the CreateDeckOfCards class, and proceeds to start the game of Go Fish.
//Player 1 is the user, and more players are computer generated, where their choices of whom to steal cards from and what cards to steal are completely random,
//with the addition of some abilities to hold "memory" of which players have what cards in common.
//The player with the most 4-of-a-kinds at the end of the game is the winner!
